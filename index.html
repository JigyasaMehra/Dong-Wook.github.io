      <p>Soo Yeol, the competent ‚Äòbad boy‚Äô on the police squad, regains his humanity after meeting K, the righteous but ‚Äòcrazy‚Äô guy.

Despite having a mere high school diploma, Soo Yeol is an accomplished member of the Anti Corruption Unit. He‚Äôs ambitious, so he chooses pet cases of his superiors and produces their desired outcomes. Often that means turning a blind eye to injustice, especially if it stands in the way of those preferred results.

With promotion time looming and without anyone‚Äôs backing, Soo Yeol fears exclusion once again. Congressman Do Yoo Gon had given him some hope of advancement but dashed when the righteous but crazy K entered his life.

What can go wrong when the bad boy and the crazy guy join forces?
